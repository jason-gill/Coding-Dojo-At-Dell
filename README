8/11/2010 - Third coding dojo session.

We continued looking at the http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR problem.

We focused on reading multiple account numbers from a file.  The required us to
refactor the code from session two.

7/14/2010 - Second coding dojo session.

We continued looking at the http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR problem.

We focused on reading an account number from a file.

Lesson learned: Don't use i,j,k as looping index variable names, name them something
meaningful like rowIndex and columnIndex.

=================================================

6/9/2010 - First coding dojo session.

We starting looking at the http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR problem.
After some white board discussions and some TDD we ended up with a
pretty good start at parsing the ascii digits into numbers.  We decided
to continue working on this problem during the next coding dojo session.

In the next session we will focus on actually parsing the whole
account number and hopefully get into some error handling.
