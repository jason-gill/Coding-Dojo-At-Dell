6/9/2010 - First coding dojo session.

We starting looking at the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR">KataBankOCR</a> problem.
After some white board discussions and some TDD we ended up with a
pretty good start at parsing the ascii digits into numbers.  We decided
to continue working on this problem during the next coding dojo session.

In the next session we will focus on actually parsing the whole
account number and hopefully get into some error handling.
